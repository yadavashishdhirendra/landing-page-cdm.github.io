                    </p>
                    <p>We were not only tasked with bringing their online presence up to date, but also creating
                        something beautiful and unique complimenting their stunning property design. They wanted the new

                        keeping them one step ahead of their competitors.

                <h2>We’re changing the way people look at the solar industry.</h2>
                <p class="branding">Development Branding</p>
                <div>
                    <p>We do understand the importance of branding in order to provide a business an extra edge; so
                        we’ve
                        come up with some customized stationeries which level-up their branding game. No more to say,
                        let
                        the stationery do the talking!</p>
                    <p>When we first started working with Fletcher Homes, they did not have any brand identity for each
                        of
                        their developments across Shropshire.
                    </p>
                    <p>Following the release of their Shrewsbury site, Berrington Meadows, we evolved development
                        branding
                        we had created years earlier, using the first letters from the development name to create a sub
                        logo. This was enhanced with a light blue colour to define the developments.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2022 we evolved the development branding further, introducing a soft meadow inspired colour
                        palette that compliments the Fletcher Homes blue perfectly. Each development logo includes the
                        first
                        letters, as previous, but are enhanced with a soft pop of colour and the implementation of
                        either a
                        flower or leaf, which weaves from the letter. This means each development brand logo is fully
                        unique
                        to the location and USPs of the homes. This icon is still ‘housed’ within a box, which sits
                        under
                        the main Fletcher Homes branding.</p>
